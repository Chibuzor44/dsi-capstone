Final Proposal Specifications
Purpose: Begin to organize actual capstone project.

Include the following:

1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon (i.e. as if you were explaining to a salesperson, executive, or recruiter).
*With the explosion of e-commerce, online stores are becoming more convenient for a lot of shoppers. Most online stores like Amazon tent to maximize profit by offering variety of of their product to shoppers in form of recommendations using the user's shopping habits. For a book online store, it is not as simple as looking at the book cover and knowing you will be interested in reading the book as most book covers do not mirror exactly the content of the book. Most people rely on person to person recommendation of books to read or prior knowledge of excerpts of the book before making a purchase. This is where recommender systems come in handy. The goal of this capstone is to build a recommender engine that will model other user's book preference through their ratings and predict the ratings of all books a user have not read and recommend books with high prediction to the users. The assumption here is that users who have not rated a particular book.*

2. How has this problem been solved before? If you feel like you are addressing a novel issue, what similar problems have been solved, and how are you borrowing from those?
 *This problem have been solved using different techniques in the past such as SVD, UVD, ALS etc.*

3. What is new about your approach, why do you think it will be successful?
  *I will be exploring different methodologies to and compare the models to see which one produces the best result for this scenario.*

4. Who cares? If you're successful, what will the impact be?
*Online book retailer will benefit from book recommendation.*

5. How will you present your work?
      * Web app - where will you host it, what kind of information will you present?

      * Presentation - *slides*

6. What are your data sources? What is the size of your dataset, and what is your storage format?
  *Source: book-crossing.com.
  Size: 120.8MB, split into three files.
  Storage format: csv*

7. What are potential problems with your capstone, and what have you done to mitigate these problems?
*The matrix will be sparse*

8. What is the next thing you need to work on?
      *Understanding the data*
      *Building a minimum viable product*
      *Gauging how much signal might be in the data*
