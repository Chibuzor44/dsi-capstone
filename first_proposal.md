Final Proposal Specifications
Purpose: Begin to organize actual capstone project.

1. What are you trying to do?
  *With the explosion of online services, customers tend to rely heavily on advice from other customers through user reviews given by users that have used these services. Yelp is a popular review online service for restaurants and other businesses. This presents an opportunity for these restaurants to use these feedbacks to gauge their service performance and improve on poorly performed areas in their services. Most restaurants rely star ratings to gauge user experience, but star rating does not necessarily reveal the cause of a user satisfaction/dissatisfaction. This capstone will focus on using natural language processing to analyze user reviews to extract most common service issues associated with a restaurant.*

2. How has this problem been solved before? If you feel like you are addressing a novel issue, what similar problems have been solved, and how are you borrowing from those?

*Most research works done in this area tend to focus on classifying user sentences into positive or negative reviews. This capstone will follow the same path but with a slight difference, instead of classifying sentences into positive and negative, the cause of the the negative or positive sentence will be extracted as the goal is to help restaurants improve in customer satisfaction*

3. What is new about your approach, why do you think it will be successful?
  *Extracting the cause of users sentiment expressed in a review and grouping common issues together. Hypothetically, this approach should work because most of the calculation will be similar to classifying into negative and positive review.*

4. Who cares? If you're successful, what will the impact be?
  *Every business is interested in improving their service delivery to keep customers happy all the time. Any business will continue to grow with service improvements but only if they know the areas of improvement. This method can be applied not only to restaurants, but any business that users leave reviews about the business' performance.*

5. How will you present your work?
  * Presentation - slides, interpretive dance?
  *Slides.*

6. What are your data sources? What is the size of your dataset, and what is your storage format?
  *Yelp business dataset
      Size: 145 MB
      Format: json
   Yelp business review dataset
      Size: 4.21 GB
      Format: json*

7. What are potential problems with your capstone, and what have you done to mitigate these problems?
*Run time will be a problem. I expect to have a large sparse matrix.
*The reviews will have slangs, spelling errors, and abbreviations which can make similar sentences dissimilar.*
8. What is the next thing you need to work on?
  *Understanding the data?
   Building a minimum viable product?
   Gauging how much signal might be in the data?*
