# Galvanize Data Science Immersive Capstone (In Progress)

## Quantifying customers experience with NLP
<br>

#### Overview
<p>
With the explosion of online services, customers tend to rely heavily on advice from other customers through user reviews given by users that have used these services. Yelp is a popular review online service for restaurants and other businesses. This presents an opportunity for these restaurants to use these feedbacks to gauge their service performance and improve on poorly performed areas in their services. Most restaurants rely star ratings to gauge user experience, but star rating does not necessarily reveal the cause of a user satisfaction/dissatisfaction. This capstone will focus on using natural language processing to analyze user reviews to extract most common service issues associated with a restaurant.
</p>
<p>
Most research works done in this area tend to focus on classifying user sentences into positive or negative reviews. This capstone will follow the same path but with a slight difference, instead of classifying sentences into positive and negative, the aspects of the negativeness or positiveness of a review will be extracted as the goal is to help restaurants improve in customer satisfaction
</p>
<p>
Extracting the cause of users sentiment expressed in a review and grouping common issues together. Hypothetically, this approach should work because most of the calculation will be similar to classifying into negative and positive review.
</p>
<p>
Every business is interested in improving their service delivery to keep customers happy all the time. Any business will continue to grow with service improvements but only if they know the areas of improvement. This method can be applied not only to restaurants, but any business that users leave reviews about the business' performance.

#### Datasets
<p>
I used three sets of data from <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge">yelp</a>, which is a publicly available dataset. The datasets are as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>Business dataset that describes all sorts of businesses that provide services to the general public. The            dataset has 174,567 records from ---- to -----.</li>
  <li>Review dataset is a records customer reviews of differnt business in the business data collected from ---- to ----. The dataset is holds 5,261,669 records.</li>
  <li>User dataset holds the record of users who have given reviews and and what businesses they have given reviews for. The         user data has 1,326,101 records from ---- to ----.</li>
  </ul>

#### Methodology
<p>
  
</p>

#### Challenges
<p>
  Run time will be a problem. I expect to have a large sparse matrix. The reviews will have slangs, spelling errors, and          abbreviations which can make similar sentences dissimilar.
